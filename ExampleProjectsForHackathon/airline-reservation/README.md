## Useful Extra Features
* The user can email himself/herself their reservation itinerary at any time.
* The departure/return flights can be changed at any time even after paying for the reservation(taking into account that the price difference will have to be paid).

  const token = req.headers["x-access-token"]?.split(" ")[1];
  console.log(token);
  if (token) {
    jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
      if (err)
        return res.json({
          isLoggedIn: false,
          message: "Failed To Authenticate",
        });
